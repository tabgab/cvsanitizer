OK, so let us have an NPM graphical component that can run in a browser, 
that displays the original CV PDF document, and then displays transparent 
red boxes around the information that is marked for redaction 
(red, but transparent so we can see what the information marked for deletion
 is). The user can select a specific box and approve or delete it. 
 The user can also "approve all", meaning that all still remaining "boxes" 
 for redaction are accepted. 
 The user may also mark new sections they think should be added to the 
 "to be redacted" PII list. When the user presses approve all 
 (the final step), the tool should present the user with a popup reading: 
 "I have reviewed what personal information will be redacted before 
 LLM processing and concede to submit the remaining information to 
 LLM processing." (Agree / Reject). 
 Upon rejection, the process should be interrupted. 
 Upon Agereement, the tool should return ("Agreement verified"). 

The cvsanitizer utility should only proceed with the redaction process if this
crucial step has been secured, and a record of this agreement is stored
inside the redacted cv json file.
The only exception is "ignoreageement" mode, which is only for testing purposes
when making enhancements to the detection, etc.
Update the workflow, the readme, the documentation so that the utility works this way.
